### Onboarding Data

- Age: {request_data.age}
- Qualification: {request_data.qualification}
- Goals: {request_data.goals}
- Challenges: {request_data.challenges}
- Background: {request_data.description}

### Instructions

Based on the above, generate a structured JSON object describing the learner using the following keys:

- `profile_summary`: A short paragraph summarizing the learnerâ€™s situation, motivation, and background.
- `strengths`: What prior knowledge, skills, or attitudes may help this learner succeed?
- `barriers`: What challenges, gaps, or misconceptions may limit their learning?
- `preferred_style`: Inferred learning preferences or instructional approaches likely to resonate (e.g. visual, structured steps, relevance to career).
- `instructional_goals`: What should the tutor aim for in how it explains and supports this learner?

Respond only in this **exact JSON format**:
```json
{{
  "profile_summary": "...",
  "strengths": "...",
  "barriers": "...",
  "preferred_style": "...",
  "instructional_goals": "..."
}}
